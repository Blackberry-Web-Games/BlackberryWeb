BlackBerry has been gradually moving away from the smartphone and consumer electronics market to focus on cybersecurity, enterprise software, and IoT solutions. Over the years, they have licensed or sold various trademarks, including those related to their mobile devices. Here are some key reasons why BlackBerry gave up its trademarks:

Exit from the Smartphone Business – BlackBerry stopped manufacturing its own phones in 2016 and licensed its brand to TCL, which produced BlackBerry-branded Android phones until 2020. Since the phone business was no longer their focus, the trademarks lost strategic value.

Monetization Strategy – Instead of holding onto unused trademarks, BlackBerry has opted to sell or license them to generate revenue. In 2021, they sold a large number of patents related to mobile devices, messaging, and wireless networking.

Brand Irrelevance in Mobile – BlackBerry's brand in the smartphone industry has significantly declined, making it less valuable for their current business. Letting go of trademarks allows other companies to repurpose them.

Shifting Focus to Software & Security – BlackBerry has transitioned into a cybersecurity and enterprise software company, focusing on AI-driven security solutions, automotive software, and critical infrastructure protection.
